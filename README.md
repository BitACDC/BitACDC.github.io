# PERSONAL-PAGE

APPLICATION OF CONCEPTS TAUGHT
Looking through lots of ways to just fit everything correctly to make it look like how I envisioned it took a lot of time. I went through tons of videos just looking and google searches as well as take inspiration how a website should look like. 

DESIGN, CONTENT, CREATIVITY
Going over the design was really fun. To just mix coding with art was incredibly fun for me as I haven't experienced that much to put my art in some of my coding projects.I also primarly used figma as my way of designing it more neatly since I have experienced with figma back in the previous semester. Just expressing myself in making this website was both challenging but quite satisfying to just see everything fall into place

LT0 - M1M2 (GUIDED EXERCISES)
Going over everything in detail and step by step the guided exercises was both fun and information friendly. I don't feel like being bombarded with info but it slowly eases me to learn and understand without feeling left behind.

IMPROVEMENTS
I really want to create a website filled with personality and also express my artistic vision but then again I can admit it can get messy. I like the designing aspect and had experience with art but I feel like designing a website is a whole other thing. But I want to design more and properly to make my websites quite stylish and unique hopefully.
